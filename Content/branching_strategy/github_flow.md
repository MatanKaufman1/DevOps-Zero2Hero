GitHub Flow is a lightweight branching model mainly used for continuous deployment and collaborative development. It's designed for web apps or services where you deploy often (even daily).
✅ GitHub Flow – Basic Branches

It typically uses just two types of branches:

    main (or master) – Always deployable.

    feature-branches – Named after the feature or fix you're working on, like fix-login-bug or add-dark-mode.
